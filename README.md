## Motivation behind this?
Group project part of BeCode training in Brussels. 4 days to do this. <br/>

We have to build an online chat app using the following technologies : 
	- Node.js
	- install libraries via npm dependency manager
	- librairies to use : 
		- Express.js -> web application framework
		- Socket.io -> library enabling real-time interactions between the client and the server side

## Mission
- Write our server with Node.js and Express.js
- Handle requests from the client side and server side in real-time 
- Allow different users to interact in the chatbot
- Keep messages even when the page is refreshed

If we finish this we can think of implementing the following :
 - Implement a battleship game
 - Users can write in MarkDown in the chatbot
 - Users can edit or delete their messages
 - Update user info : picture, pseudo, description
